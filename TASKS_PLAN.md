## MVP Task Plan

Below is a task-oriented breakdown for delivering the MVP described in the repository's README. Tasks are grouped by client-side and server-side responsibilities, keeping in mind a UI/UX that balances the clean simplicity of OpenAI with the cannabis-focused style of Leafly.com.

---

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

1. **Project Bootstrapping**
   - Initialize React + TypeScript project.
   - Set up routing and state management (React Router, Redux or Context API).
   - Configure ESLint/Prettier for consistent code formatting.

2. **Core Layout & Styling**
   - Design global UI components (header, footer, navigation) with a modern look that blends OpenAI’s minimalist approach with Leafly’s branding.
   - Implement a responsive design system (e.g., styled-components or Tailwind) with a color palette reflecting a professional yet cannabis-friendly theme.
   - Build a layout for public pages vs. authenticated user pages.

3. **Authentication Pages**
   - Create login and registration forms.
   - Integrate with backend authentication API.
   - Provide social sign-in placeholder buttons (Google, etc.) if part of future roadmap.

4. **Strain Search & Recommendations**
   - Develop a search bar and input interface for users to describe their needs in natural language.
   - Display recommended strains, effects, and availability using a card/grid format.
   - Include sorting and filtering (e.g., THC/CBD levels, flavor, region).

5. **User Reviews & Ratings**
   - Implement review submission form (rating sliders, text field).
   - Display community reviews and rating summaries per strain.
   - Provide upvote/downvote buttons for helpful reviews.

6. **Dispensary Finder**
   - Integrate with Google Maps API (or other mapping service) to locate nearby dispensaries.
   - Show inventory status (if available via API) and delivery options.
   - Provide an interface for selecting a dispensary to order or check stock.

7. **User Dashboard**
   - Allow users to view saved favorites, past reviews, and personalized recommendations.
   - Optionally show basic account settings.

8. **Responsive UX Testing**
   - Validate layout across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
   - Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) and performance optimization.

### Backend (Node.js + TypeScript with Express)

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Node.js project with TypeScript.
   - Configure Express server with TypeScript compilation (ts-node or build step).
   - Apply linting (ESLint) and testing frameworks (Jest/Mocha).

2. **Database Models**
   - Design PostgreSQL schema for users, strains, reviews, and dispensaries.
   - Implement ORM/Query builder (e.g., TypeORM, Prisma, or Sequelize).
   - Set up basic seed data for initial strains.

3. **Authentication API**
   - Implement user registration, login, and JWT-based session handling.
   - Provide protected routes for review submission and favorites.

4. **Strain Index & Search Endpoint**
   - Build endpoints to fetch, create, and update strain profiles.
   - Integrate AI layer: wrap ChatGPT for strain classification and store results.
   - Apply geolocation filters and regional compliance checks.

5. **Reviews & Ratings API**
   - Create endpoints to submit, edit, and list reviews.
   - Implement rating calculations (average ratings, vote counts).
   - Add moderation hooks for flagged content.

6. **Dispensary & Stock API Integration**
   - Connect to the Israeli medical cannabis API (or placeholder data).
   - Provide routes for checking strain availability by region or dispensary.
   - Expose delivery options and cost estimates.

7. **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Layer**
   - Implement middleware that enriches requests with location, language, and compliance context.
   - Ensure AI queries and responses respect regional rules.

8. **Caching & Performance**
   - Use Redis for caching popular strain searches and reviews.
   - Add rate limiting to prevent API overuse and malicious traffic.

9. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Write unit and integration tests for critical endpoints.
   - Generate API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger).
   - Ensure environment variables for API keys, database connections, and secret tokens are managed securely.

### Deployment & Operations

1. **Development and Production Builds**
   - Configure TypeScript build processes for frontend and backend.
   - Set up environment-specific configs (dev vs. prod API endpoints, logging).

2. **Containerization**
   - Provide Dockerfiles for frontend and backend services.
   - Optionally compose with a docker-compose file including PostgreSQL and Redis.

3. **Monitoring and Error Reporting**
   - Integrate logging system (e.g., Winston, Morgan) and monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, or a hosted service).
   - Set up alerting for critical errors or uptime issues.

4. **Security and Compliance**
   - Ensure HTTPS for all connections.
   - Implement content security policies and basic rate limiting.
   - Include disclaimers on cannabis usage, medical advice, and regional restrictions.

### UI/UX Considerations

- **Visual Style**: Combine OpenAI’s minimal, whitespace-focused layout with Leafly’s colorful imagery and friendly typography. Use clean fonts and subtle animations to keep the interface modern and approachable.
- **Navigation**: Prioritize simple, direct navigation—clearly defined “Search,” “Reviews,” “Dispensaries,” and “Profile” sections.
- **Accessibility**: Provide high-contrast options and ensure screen reader support to comply with web accessibility standards.
- **Interactions**: Maintain short, conversational elements when presenting AI suggestions, but include informative strain detail panels akin to Leafly’s product pages.

This plan covers both client and server tasks necessary to achieve the MVP goals outlined in the README: strain recommendations, review system, regional context handling, and dispensary connections. Continuous testing, user feedback, and iterative design will help maintain a UI/UX that merges the straightforward nature of OpenAI with the cannabis-focused feel of Leafly.
